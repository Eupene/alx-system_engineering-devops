shell initialization

A shell initialization (Shell Init) file is a shell script that runs automatically each time the shell executes. The initialization file sets up the “work environment” and “customizes” the shell environment for the user. The main agenda of Shell initialization files are to persist common shell configuration, such as:

$PATH and other environment variables
shell prompt
shell tab-completion
aliases, functions
key bindings

Shell variables

A shell variable is a character string in shell that stores some value. It could be an integer, filename, string or some shell command itself. Basically, it is a pointer to the actual data stored in memory.
